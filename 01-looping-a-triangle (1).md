# Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 7; i++) {
  console.log('#'.repeat(i));
}
```

It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

```js
let abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// â†’ 3
```
